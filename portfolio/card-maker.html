             <p class="info">Shindigz.com is a website the sells products for birthdays, parties, holidays, and other celebrations.
							 However, The user experience for customizing greeting cards is currently unorganized, slow paced, and unenjoyable.
							 We want to make the process for our customer very enjoyable so they share their experience with friends and return to the site to make cards in the future.
							 Moreover, this site has a poorly designed outlook and does not create a visual interest to the user.

								 <p class=" info slideanim">We want to completely reconstruct the format of the design and switch over to an application format.
								 We will organize each category for specific occasions so the user can easily click which one they desire.
								 We will get give them a step by step design process to change text, font, background, and insert images into their greeting card to make it completely unique.
								 At the end of their user journey, they will be able to send a physical or electronic card to whoever they wish.
								 They will also be able to share their design on Facebook and twitter to share their unique design as well as promote our product.</p>

					 <h3 class="slideanim">discovery</h3>

					 <p class=" info slideanim">
					 With our in-depth exploration and research, we found that the page for greeting cards has no instant separation for celebrations or holidays. There also is no step by step format for how to customize a greeting card, which can be difficult for a first time user.
					 There is also no way to save progress or share results.
					 So as a UX designer, I start the design process by conducting user research—building empathy with our target users and identifying exactly what they need from the product we’re designing.
				 	  designating persona types and aligning this with our phasing strategy we were able to prioritise who we would be focusing on supporting in the early stages. </p>

					 <div class="quote slideanim"><p>"A user persona is a fictional representation of your ideal customer."</p></div>

					 <p class=" info slideanim">Our persona hypothesis consisted of two different archetypes which we used to facilitate discussions about our users needs, desires and varying contexts of use.
						 Through careful analysis of our research, we identified sufficient behavioural variables to segment our user audience.
						 These variables could be categorised into activities such as frequency of use social media, skills in use of computer and motivations.
						 We discussed the personas in our group to develop a clear picture of who the design of the app would target in begining phase and later in future releases.</p>

				We decided to build a new card making website and named it CardMaker as the first step to start this project.
				Through discussions within the group, we hope that the <b>LOGO</b> of the website is attractive and adds the current minimalist style.
				As a designer, I provided the team with several drafts of different styles. After voting, we adopted a logo that uses abstract font shapes.</p></div>
